title: Anger is an emotion that we can control
---

One example from the book is *anger*. Anger is an instantaneous emotion and we often feel that we can't control them. Whenever we got angry we shout. *Anger* is the emotion and *shouting* is the action we take according to our emotion. Actually we can communicate anger in a different way but we choose shouting so people will listen to us. Anger is also a tool that can be taken out at any time we want to.
