title: We choose to be unhappy
---

Were we born unhappy?
Of course not. We’re born equally.
But in later stages in life we choose to be unhappy because of our situation. Maybe it’s financial, family, and you can mention anything else. We choose our own happiness. 

To change your condition you should ask yourself why we choose to be unhappy instead of what are the things that make us unhappy.
