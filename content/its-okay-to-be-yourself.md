title: It is okay just to be yourself but it doesn't mean that it is okay to be just as you are

We are always thought to just be ourself. Everything we do something wrong we always say that “I am being me”.
It is okay to be yourself but it does not mean that we have to be as we are. We can change to be better. If we are not happy maybe we should change.

To be happy we should focus on what we have, not what we don’t.
