title: About these notes
---

Hi, I'm [Julian Christian Anderson](https://juliancanderson.com) ðŸ‘‹

I have been wanting to build a public notes but haven't had the time to build it. I was inspired by [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). And thanks to [Aravind Balla](https://twitter.com/aravindballa) for his work on [gatsby-theme-andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy/), I am able to finally publish this.


I'm learning to write more this year.

This idea is inspired from [Max Stoiber](https://notes.mxstbr.com/) and [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). This project is [opensource](https://github.com/aravindballa/notes.aravindballa.com/), built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) and uses [gatsby-theme-andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy/).
