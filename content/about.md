title: About these notes
---

Hi, I'm [Julian Christian Anderson](https://juliancanderson.com) ðŸ‘‹

I have been wanting to build a public notes but haven't had the time to build it. I was inspired by [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). And thanks to [Aravind Balla](https://twitter.com/aravindballa) for his work on [gatsby-theme-andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy/), I am able to finally publish this.

I'm learning to [[Write]] more this year. I am planning to use this note to write [[Book Summaries]].

Currently:
- Summarizing [[The Courage to be Disliked]]
- Practicing [[How to Take Smart Notes - SÃ¶nke Ahrens]]
- Writing [[Morning Pages]]
