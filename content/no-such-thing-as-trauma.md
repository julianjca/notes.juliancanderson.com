title: There is no such thing as trauma
---

> "No experience in itself a cause of our success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences - the so-called trauma - but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes. We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining."

We make up our own trauma to fit our situation.  We are using trauma as an excuse for not to change. We use it whenever we want to deny something.

This point of view is really interesting for me because I feel like I have my own trauma for a lot of things. It stops me from doing what I really want to do in life. I tend to pull out those *trauma* whenever we needed to. And by *denying trauma* doesn't mean that those horrible past experiences don't have any effects on us, the experience is real but they don't determine our future.
