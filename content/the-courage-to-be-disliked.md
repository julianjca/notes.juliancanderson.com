The book is divided into 5 parts:

## [[Deny Trauma]]
Trauma doesn't exist, we usually pull out our past experiences to achieve a goal from it.

## All Problems are interpersonal relationship problems

## Discard other people's task

## Where the center of the world is
 
## To live in earnest here and now
