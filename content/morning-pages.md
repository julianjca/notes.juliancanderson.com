> Morning Pages are three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing,
done first thing in the morning. *There is no wrong way to do Morning Pages*–
they are not high art. They are not even “writing.” They are about
anything and everything that crosses your mind– and they are for your eyes
only. Morning Pages provoke, clarify, comfort, cajole, prioritize and
synchronize the day at hand. Do not over-think Morning Pages: just put
three pages of anything on the page...and then do three more pages tomorrow.

I am writing morning pages to practice my writing. Currently I am writing random things and it feels pretty good. Sometimes it is hard to write every single day because I don't really know what to write. Morning Pages solve this problem for me and I hope that these random thoughts can turn into an essay in the future.
